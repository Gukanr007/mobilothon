## **How It Works**

### **Technology Stack**

1. **Front-End Development**:

   - Built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for cross-platform mobile app development.
   - UI designed to prioritize ease of use and clear navigation.

2. **Back-End Services**:

   - API integration for navigation, parking, and energy management using services like Google Maps and energy-sharing APIs.
   - Simulated vehicle diagnostics and predictive maintenance using rule-based logic and mock data.

3. **AI Integration**:

   - Predictive maintenance algorithms analyze driving behavior and historical patterns.
   - Accident detection powered by accelerometer data simulators.

4. **Third-Party APIs**:
   - Smart Parking Assistance: Integrates APIs like [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
   - Energy Dashboard: Uses mock battery data for real-time visuals.
